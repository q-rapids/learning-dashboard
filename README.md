# Learning Dashboard ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache2.0-blue.svg)
Learning Dashboard is a tool to visualize and monitor the achievement of learning objectives in subjects based on the team development of software projects.

## Main Functionality
The main functionalities of the current version of the Learning Dashboard are: providing several ways to visualize and explore the available data, generate predictions of the existing assessments, perform simulations on how the strategic indicators will evolve based on the value of the factors and generate quality requirements to correct deviations on the assessments.

The **User's Guide** is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Learning-Dashboard/LD-learning-dashboard/wiki/User-Guide).

## How to build
This is a Gradle project. You can use any IDE that supports Gradle to build it, or alternatively you can use the command line using the Gradle wrapper with the command *__gradlew__* if you don't have Gradle installed on your machine or with the command *__gradle__* if you do, followed by the task *__war__*.

```
# Example: using Gradle wrapper to build with dependencies
cd LD-learning-dashboard
gradlew war
```
After the build is done the WAR file can be found at the __build/libs__ directory
