# Q-Rapids Strategic Dashboard ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache2.0-blue.svg) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/q-rapids/qrapids-dashboard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/q-rapids/qrapids-dashboard) [![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=q-rapids_qrapids-dashboard&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=q-rapids_qrapids-dashboard)
A dashboard for visualizing the quality of the company's products. This strategic dashboard is complemented with some specific features to support decision-makers managing **quality requirements**.

This component has been created as a result of the Q-Rapids project funded by the European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under grant agreement No 732253.

## Main Functionality
The main functionalities of the current version of Q-Rapids Dashboard are: providing several ways to visualize and explore the available data, generate predictions of the existing assessments, perform simulations on how the strategic indicators will evolve based on the value of the factors and generate quality requirements to correct deviations on the assessments.

The **User's Guide** is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/q-rapids/qrapids-dashboard/wiki/User-Guide).
